version 0.7.0
=============

* not 0.6.8 because our commandline args have changed and we have some new args to lib functions.
* now supports passing -t to specify a task (and its dependencies) to complete.
  - this runs ONLY that subtree.
* now REQUIRES -c or --config to manually specify config location.
