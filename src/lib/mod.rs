//! hm is a commandline program to help with dotfile (and more) management.
//!
//! It can handle putting configuration files where they should go, but its real
//! strength lies in the solutions it'll execute - shell scripts, usually - to
//! pull a git repository, compile something from source, etc.
//!
//! hm exists because I bring along a few utilities to all Linux boxes I regularly
//! use, and those are often built from source. So rather than manually install
//! all dependency libraries, then build each dependent piece, then finally the
//! top-level dependent program, I built hm.
//! It also provides functionality to thread off heavier operations
//! into task threads, which regularly report back their status with
//! Worker objects over a `std::sync::mpsc`.
//!
//! `hm` can also perform dependency resolution, thanks to the solvent crate. You can
//! provide a big ol' list of tasks to complete, each with their own dependencies, and
//! as long as you have a solveable dependency graph, you can get workable batches from
//! get_task_batches(). They will be in *some* order that will resolve your dependencies,
//! but that order is non-deterministic - if there's multiple ways to solve a graph,
//! you'll probably get all those different ways back if you run it multiple times.
//!
//! The crate provides this library, which is in turn used by the bin `hm` (in `src/bin/main.rs`).

//!  1. create a config.toml file either anywhere or in ~/.config/homemaker/.
//!  2. enter things to do things to in the file.
//!  example:
//!  ``` text
//!  ## config.toml
//!
//!  [[obj]]
//!  file = 'tmux.conf'
//!  source = '~/dotfiles/.tmux.conf'
//!  destination = '~/.tmux.conf'
//!  method = 'symlink'
//!
//!  [[obj]]
//!  task = 'zt'
//!  solution = 'cd ~/dotfiles/zt && git pull'
//!  dependencies = 'maim, slop'
//!
//!  [[obj]]
//!  task = 'slop'
//!  source = '~/dotfiles/zt/slop'
//!  solution = 'cd ~/dotfiles/zt/slop; make clean; cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="/usr" ./ && make && sudo make install'
//!  method = 'execute'
//!  platform = "linux::debian"
//!  ```
